				<p>Buy land on Mercury before it is too Late! Land on Mercury is
					selling so fast our realtors cannot keep up! Aging on Mercury is
					nearly impossible, one day on Mercury is equivalent to 176 days on
					Earth. A year on Mercury is made up of 88 days. That means one year
					on Mercury is 15,488 boring old Earth days. If you're 42 on Earth
					on Mercury you would have just been born. Now, what about if you
					were thirty you ask?! You have 12 more years before you're EVEN
					born. You don't want to miss out on an opportunity like that, now
					do you? If you then I guess we'll see you later geezer!</p>
